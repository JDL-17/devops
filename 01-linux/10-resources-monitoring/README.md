# Monitoring resources in Linux

## Top Command

`top` command used to monitor system processes in real-time. It provides a dynamic, interactive view of the processes running on a Linux system, displaying information such as CPU usage, memory usage, process IDs (PIDs), and other relevant details.

### Basic usage:
```bash
top
```

> Once inside the top command: <br>
> `V` -> Process childrens visualization <br>
> `P` -> Order by **process** usage <br>
> `M` -> Order by **memory** usage <br>
> `k` -> Kill a process (requieres PID) <br>
